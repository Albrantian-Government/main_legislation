It was said in the great books of history that the ones of the great kingdoms of the past once tried to create paradise. As we all know, they did not succeed. In the time after the great ones, there was chaos. The times were bleak and many suffered. We as a single group, a single force, stand to change that. We stand as Unity; We stand as Order; We stand as Purity; And we stand as the onse who will defend their position, their honor, and all that they believe it. We will not stand for chaos, because we are the people of Albrantia. Albrantia is Unity. Albrantia is MIGHT!
